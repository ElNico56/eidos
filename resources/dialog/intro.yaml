#     - I can't believe the day is finally here! I've been waiting the whole summer for this!
#     - I've wanted to go to Resa Academy for as long as I can remember.
#     - Do you see that building over there? The main complex? I have a poster of it in my room.

#     - Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't notice. You don't have a cane or glasses or anything.
#     - Wait, how are you finding your way around the campus then?
#     - ...
#     - Oh! I know! You use magic, don't you?

#     - So, have you guys decided what kind of magic you are going to study?
#     - right: Sanuo
#     - speaker: Sanuo
#     - I'm doing Entropics.
#     - I like the idea of choosing how things should be and making it happen.
#     - And of course, you can also blow stuff up.
#     - speaker: Kalisa
#     - I'm studying Kinetics.
#     - I've always had this idea in my head of flying over the landscape and conjuring buildings from the ground up.
#     - What about you, (name)? Do you know what you want to study?
#   children:
#     not_sure:
#       [I'm not sure yet. I'm still trying to figure out what I'm good at.]
#     dont_know:
#       [I don't know much about the different types of magic. What is there?]
# not_sure:
#   lines:
#     - That's fine. We'll be starting out with basic magic classes anyway, so you'll have time to decide.
# dont_know:

#     - Wow! How can you not know?
#     - 'There are four main fields of magical study: Kinetics, Thermics, Entropics, and Mnemonics.'
#     - Kinetics is the study of movement and force. Kinetists manipulate physical and magical forces to move objects around.
#     - Thermics is the study of temperature and heat. Thermists make things hotter or colder, and they can change the state of matter.
#     - Entropics is the study of order. Entropists define a proper state for objects, and they can make things more or less ordered acording to that state.
#     - Finally, Mnemonics is the study of information storage, retrieval, processing. Mnemonists write highly-complex spells to automate casting that a magician would otherwise have to do manually.
#     - All types of magic are important, and every magician should know a little bit of everything, but most people choose to specialize in one type or another.
#     - So, what do you think? Which one sounds the most interesting to you?
#   children:
#     kinetics: [Kinetics sounds neat. I like the idea of moving things around.]
#     thermics: [Thermics sounds cool \(pun intended\).]
#     entropics:
#       [
#         Entropics sounds cool. I like the idea of making things more or less ordered.,
#       ]
#     mnemonics:
#       [Mnemonics sounds cool. I like the idea of writing complex spells.]
