# Lore

Magic the manifestation of physical phenomena in response to the mental structuring of certain people.
People who can manifest this phenomena are know as magicians.

Magicians cast spells by building structures in their minds to manipulate magical fields.
They often do this by speaking words which they have associated with various structures.

In the days of old, magicians planned their spells on paper. This was better than constructing
them in the mind alone, but it was still error prone. As invoking the wrong structuring
on magical fields could result in dangerous effects, the smallest miscalculation in
hand-written spell could lead to disaster.

In time, Spell Verification Assistants, or SVAs, were invented to ensure that spells would
be safe and correct before they were cast. SVAs are small handheld devices made of metal or
wood that are imbued with magical matrices to generate an interface.
