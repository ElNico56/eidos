# Mechanics

The core mechanic is the manipulation of magical fields based on a stack-oriented language.
There are input fields for reading the world state and output fields for affecting the world.
A spell is a list of words that ultimately write to an output field.

## Possible things to do with this system

Any context used to motivate the use of this mechanic will be necessarily puzzle-like.
With that in mind, some possible core gameplay loops involve:
- Stationary puzzle solving, where each level is a self contained logic challenge requiring clever spellcraft
  - Pros: 
    - Simpler to implement
    - Requires little story
  - Cons: 
    - Limited avenues for progression and customization
- Town game where you are the town magician/apprentice
  - Pros: 
    - Opportunity for narrative
    - Richer experience
  - Cons: 
    - A lot of work
    - Have to figure out how to resolve freedom and the interests of NPCs
    - May require artificial restrictions on player agency
- Mathemagical combat?
  - Pros:
    - Could be really cool
    - Lots of opportunity for enemy spell design
  - Cons:
    - A lot of work
    - Magic system is probably too complex for fast-paced spell construction

## Maybe a combination of all of these

Each level is a self-contained challenge to solve some problem.
The play space is mostly limited to the problem area.
